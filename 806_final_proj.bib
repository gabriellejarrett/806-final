	abstract = {Concerns regarding plastic pollution, especially microplastics, have increased, as they can be present in different environmental compartments, including estuarine areas and saltmarshes. Although saltmarshes are highly vulnerable to different human activities and pressures, they have the ability to trap/retain contaminants in their vegetated sediments. However, there is still little information regarding the role of saltmarshes in microplastic retention. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the capability of an estuarine saltmarsh to trap microplastics by comparing microplastic concentrations in vegetated (saltmarsh) and non-vegetated sediments. Microplastic content from sediment (vegetated and non-vegetated) samples collected at different sampling sites in Lima River estuary was estimated using previously optimised extraction protocols, and the observed particles were then characterised accordingly to their size, colour, shape, and polymer (by FTIR). Water samples were also collected and analysed for their microplastics content to complement MPs characterisation within the estuarine area. Microplastics were detected in all sediment samples, with fibres being the most common type of microplastic found, followed by fragments/particles. Overall, vegetated sediments, especially those of saltmarsh species Juncus maritimus, presented a higher number of plastic items. These results indicated that microplastics tend to be trapped in vegetated sediments, supporting the fact that saltmarshes have a significant influence on the transport, distribution, and accumulation of MPs in estuarine areas.},

	abstract = {Although microplastics (MP) have been documented in estuarine habitats, limited published data exist for New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts hampering meaningful, regional comparison with other geographies. Here we synthesize previously unpublished data from several independent baseline studies spanning three estuarine systems including Great Bay Estuary (GBE), Hampton-Seabrook Estuary (HSE), and Great Marsh Estuary (GME) to compare geographic data for MP to other published regional studies. Data include water column in GBE (n  = 179 from 7 sites), surface waters and salt marsh sediment cores from HSE (n  = 72 water samples from 12 sites and n  = 77  sediment cores from 8 sites), and surface waters from GME (n  = 42 water samples at 10 sites). Samples were analyzed for MP characteristics initially via either automated confocal microscopy or light microscopy, allowing initial estimation of the number and size distribution of putative MP. Particles from representative samples were analyzed using laser direct infrared spectrometry (LDIR) to determine elemental analysis. MP were found in {\textgreater} 98\%  of samples collected including surface waters, water column, and marine sediments. Counts ranged from 1 to 144,000 MP particles m-3 and mean MP differed significantly among regions, sites within regions, and across years. In the GBE water column, MP tended to peak during June-August in 4 of the 5 years studied. Most MP were roughly circular and {\textasciitilde}50 μm in diameter. LDIR confirmed that many types of plastics are in these estuarine waters and also revealed that despite the digestion processes, biogenic materials often remained, predominantly chitin, rubber, wood, and coal. These data allow us to address the realistic levels of risk that estuarine MP pose in NH and northern MA estuaries and can be used to populate existing hydrodynamic models that will predict the tributary sources, movements, and fate of MP within these aquatic habitats.},

Consequently, the microparticles laden with high levels of POPs can be ingested by marine biota. Bioavailability and the efﬁciency of transfer of the ingested POPs across trophic levels are not known and the potential damage posed by these to the marine ecosystem has yet to be quantiﬁed and modelled.

The review included a total of 61 studies, which highlighted: (a) the importance of estuarine ecosystem services; (b) the stress placed on estuaries as a result of human activity; and (c) the importance of ecosystem services to human well-being. These studies aid in our understanding of the provisioning and cultural services that ecosystems provide to humans, as well as how the ecosystem services assist individuals in diversifying their livelihoods. Our systematic review revealed that: (a) estuaries provide benefits to humans and are used for survival, (b) cultural ecosystem services are important and valuable; however, (c) as a result of human activities and climate change, ecosystem services face numerous threats such as pollution, overexploitation of resources, and poor water quality, among others. Future research should focus on how estuary users perceive the ecosystem services that estuaries provide, and there should be more publications and studies on the benefits that estuaries provide. The systematic review highlighted that most studies are outdated, there are few to no new studies on ecosystem services and estuaries, and those that are available do not directly address the importance of estuaries.},

            Microplastics are contaminants of increasing global environmental concern. Estuaries are a major transport pathway for land-derived plastics to the open ocean but are relatively understudied compared to coastal and open marine environments. The role of the “estuarine filter”, by which the supply of sediments and contaminants to the sea is moderated by processes including vegetative trapping and particle flocculation, remains poorly defined for microplastics land to sea transfer. Here, we focus on the sea surface microlayer (SML) as a vector for microplastics, and use SML sampling to assess microplastic trapping in a temperate marsh system in Southampton Water, UK. The SML is known to concentrate microplastics relative to the underlying water and is the first part of rising tidal waters to traverse intertidal and upper tidal surfaces. Sampling a salt marsh creek at high temporal resolution allowed assessment of microplastics in-wash and outflow from the salt marsh, and its relationship with tidal state and bulk suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), over spring and neap tides. A statistically significant decrease in microplastics abundance from the flood tide to the ebb tide was found, and a weak positive relationship with SSC observed.},

	abstract = {In southern New England, salt marshes are exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of accelerated sea level rise. Regional rates of sea level rise have been as much as 50 \% greater than the global average over past decades, a more than fourfold increase over late Holocene background values. In addition, coastal development blocks many potential marsh migration routes, and compensatory mechanisms relying on positive feedbacks between inundation and sediment deposition are insufficient to counter inundation increases in extreme low-turbidity tidal waters. Accordingly, multiple lines of evidence suggest that marsh submergence is occurring in southern New England. A combination of monitoring data, field re-surveys, radiometric dating, and analysis of peat composition have established that, beginning in the early and mid-twentieth century, the dominant low-marsh plant, Spartina alterniflora, has encroached upward in tidal marshes, and typical high-marsh plants, including Juncus gerardii and Spartina patens, have declined, providing strong evidence that vegetation changes are being driven, at least in part, by higher water levels. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery show shoreline retreat, widening and headward extension of channels, and new and expanded interior depressions. Papers in this special section highlight changes in marsh-building processes, patterns of vegetation loss, and shifts in species composition. The final papers turn to strategies for minimizing and coping with marsh loss by managing adaptively and planning for landward marsh migration. It is hoped that this collection offers lessons that will be of use to researchers and managers on coasts where relative sea level is not yet rising as fast as in southern New England.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is currently one of the environmental pollution issues of global concern, and microplastics (plastics with a size ≤ 5 mm) have also attracted much attention due to their large specific area, higher pollutant adsorption capacity, and higher migration performance. As the population increases and more chemical products are manufactured, the level of microplastic pollution continues to increase. Microplastics discharged from sewage treatment systems will enter the ocean and rivers, so estuary ecosystems are vital to controlling marine microplastics. As the estuary of China’s most significant river entering the East China Sea, the Changjiang River Estuary has become one of the typical areas for microplastic research in estuaries. This paper systematically reviews the sources, hazards, and impacts of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. Firstly, the research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary was analyzed, and we found that the bioaccumulation, removal, and interaction with microorganisms of microplastics have become a new research hotspot. At the same time, the current abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Changjiang River Estuary is 1.71 ± 3.12 MP/L, which is lower than that of the Changjiang River area and the river farmland in Shanghai, but still higher than the 0.22 ± 0.27 MP/L in the area adjacent to the East China Sea. Microplastics smaller than 1000 μm accounted for 68\% of the total, while transparent, white, blue, and black were the primary colors of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. In addition, polyethylene and polypropylene are the primary materials of microplastics in the central Changjiang River Estuary and related water bodies, and fibers are the main shape of microplastics. Industry, agriculture, domestic sewage, and air deposition may be the primary sources of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. The numerous lakes and water conservancy facilities in the Changjiang River Basin can reduce the number of microplastics reaching the Changjiang Estuary to a certain extent. At the same time, seasonal rainfall and ocean currents will affect the abundance of microplastics in the surface waters of the Changjiang River Estuary. Finally, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions based on the actual situation of the Changjiang River Estuary and the developed microplastic treatment technologies. This article will provide a structured reference for future research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary and assist in assessing microplastics’ impact on the ecological environment.},

We demonstrate that, in 2016, the United States generated the largest amount of plastic waste of any country in the world (42.0 Mt). Between 0.14 and 0.41 Mt of this waste was illegally dumped in the United States, and 0.15 to 0.99 Mt was inadequately managed in countries that imported materials collected in the United States for recycling. Accounting for these contributions, the amount of plastic waste generated in the United States estimated to enter the coastal environment in 2016 was up to five times larger than that estimated for 2010, rendering the United States’ contribution among the highest in the world.},

              Plastic waste has been documented in nearly all types of marine environments and has been found in species spanning all levels of marine food webs. Within these marine environments, deep pelagic waters encompass the largest ecosystems on Earth. We lack a comprehensive understanding of the concentrations, cycling, and fate of plastic waste in sub-surface waters, constraining our ability to implement effective, large-scale policy and conservation strategies. We used remotely operated vehicles and engineered purpose-built samplers to collect and examine the distribution of microplastics in the Monterey Bay pelagic ecosystem at water column depths ranging from 5 to 1000 m. Laser Raman spectroscopy was used to identify microplastic particles collected from throughout the deep pelagic water column, with the highest concentrations present at depths between 200 and 600 m. Examination of two abundant particle feeders in this ecosystem, pelagic red crabs (
              Pleuroncodes planipes
              ) and giant larvaceans (
              Bathochordaeus stygius
              ), showed that microplastic particles readily flow from the environment into coupled water column and seafloor food webs. Our findings suggest that one of the largest and currently underappreciated reservoirs of marine microplastics may be contained within the water column and animal communities of the deep sea.},

              Within the past decade, an alarm was raised about microplastics in the remote and seemingly pristine Arctic Ocean. To gain further insight about the issue, microplastic abundance, distribution and composition in sea ice cores (n = 25) and waters underlying ice floes (n = 22) were assessed in the Arctic Central Basin (ACB). Potential microplastics were visually isolated and subsequently analysed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy. Microplastic abundance in surface waters underlying ice floes (0–18 particles m
              −3
              ) were orders of magnitude lower than microplastic concentrations in sea ice cores (2–17 particles L
              −1
              ). No consistent pattern was apparent in the vertical distribution of microplastics within sea ice cores. Backward drift trajectories estimated that cores possibly originated from the Siberian shelves, western Arctic and central Arctic. Knowledge about microplastics in environmental compartments of the Arctic Ocean is important in assessing the potential threats posed by microplastics to polar organisms.},

              Plastic pollution in the ocean is a rapidly emerging global environmental concern, with high concentrations (up to 580,000 pieces per km
              2
              ) and a global distribution, driven by exponentially increasing production. Seabirds are particularly vulnerable to this type of pollution and are widely observed to ingest floating plastic. We used a mixture of literature surveys, oceanographic modeling, and ecological models to predict the risk of plastic ingestion to 186 seabird species globally. Impacts are greatest at the southern boundary of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, a region thought to be relatively pristine. Although evidence of population level impacts from plastic pollution is still emerging, our results suggest that this threat is geographically widespread, pervasive, and rapidly increasing.

              Plastic pollution in the ocean is a global concern; concentrations reach 580,000 pieces per km
              2
              and production is increasing exponentially. Although a large number of empirical studies provide emerging evidence of impacts to wildlife, there has been little systematic assessment of risk. We performed a spatial risk analysis using predicted debris distributions and ranges for 186 seabird species to model debris exposure. We adjusted the model using published data on plastic ingestion by seabirds. Eighty of 135 (59\%) species with studies reported in the literature between 1962 and 2012 had ingested plastic, and, within those studies, on average 29\% of individuals had plastic in their gut. Standardizing the data for time and species, we estimate the ingestion rate would reach 90\% of individuals if these studies were conducted today. Using these results from the literature, we tuned our risk model and were able to capture 71\% of the variation in plastic ingestion based on a model including exposure, time, study method, and body size. We used this tuned model to predict risk across seabird species at the global scale. The highest area of expected impact occurs at the Southern Ocean boundary in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, which contrasts with previous work identifying this area as having low anthropogenic pressures and concentrations of marine debris. We predict that plastics ingestion is increasing in seabirds, that it will reach 99\% of all species by 2050, and that effective waste management can reduce this threat.},

The MPs present in the environment result from the successive breakdown of larger plastic pieces or from the direct input of micro- and nano-sized particles used in various industries and products available to consumers. Such MPs have been found in several wild species and other natural resources, including some consumed as food by humans, with possible adverse eﬀects on ecosystem and human health. The central aim of this work was to review the published literature regarding the contamination of sea commercial salts (sea and terrestrial origins) and its possible impacts on human health. Moreover, to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the paradigm, a short introduction and revision of the environmental contamination by MPs and its eﬀects are included. MPs have been found in commercial salts from 128 brands, from 38 diﬀerent countries spanning over ﬁve continents. The concentration of MPs found in the samples analysed is lower than the concentrations of MPs reported in other resources, such as blue mussels. However, as commercial salts are used every day and by all humans, they constitute a long-term exposure route for the general population in addition to others (e.g., animals consumed as food by humans, water, air). Therefore, commercial salts contaminated with MPs may contribute to the potential long-term adverse eﬀects resulting from human exposure to these particles.},

	abstract = {Analyses o f habitat loss are often restricted to the past 75 years by the relative youth of aerial photography and remote sensing technologies. Although photographic techniques are highly accurate, they are unable to provide measurements of habitat loss prior to the 1950s. In this study, historical maps from the late 1700s and early 1800s covering portions of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine were used to approximate naturally ocean-ring salt marsh cover in New England. Historical data was compared to eatrrent salt marsh coverage available in public geographic information system (GIS) data sets. The average loss in New England is estimated at 37\% using this technique. Rhode Island has lost the largest proportion of salt marshes by state, a staggering 53\% loss since 1832. Massachusetts has also experienced large losses, amounting to a 41\% loss of salt marsh since 1777. The Boston area alone has lost 81\% of its salt marshes. Salt marsh loss was highly correlated with urban growth. Restoration and preservation efforts have resulted in the retention of salt marsh in less populated areas of New England. Although historical maps are difficult to verify, they represent an extremely valuable and underused data repository. Using historical maps to trace land use practices is an effee{\textasciitilde}ve way to overcome the short-term nature of many ecological studies. This technique could be appfied to other habitats and other regions, wherever accurate historical maps are available. Analysis of historic conditions of habitats can help conservation managers determine appropriate goals for restoration and management.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is currently one of the environmental pollution issues of global concern, and microplastics (plastics with a size ≤ 5 mm) have also attracted much attention due to their large specific area, higher pollutant adsorption capacity, and higher migration performance. As the population increases and more chemical products are manufactured, the level of microplastic pollution continues to increase. Microplastics discharged from sewage treatment systems will enter the ocean and rivers, so estuary ecosystems are vital to controlling marine microplastics. As the estuary of China’s most significant river entering the East China Sea, the Changjiang River Estuary has become one of the typical areas for microplastic research in estuaries. This paper systematically reviews the sources, hazards, and impacts of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. Firstly, the research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary was analyzed, and we found that the bioaccumulation, removal, and interaction with microorganisms of microplastics have become a new research hotspot. At the same time, the current abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Changjiang River Estuary is 1.71 ± 3.12 MP/L, which is lower than that of the Changjiang River area and the river farmland in Shanghai, but still higher than the 0.22 ± 0.27 MP/L in the area adjacent to the East China Sea. Microplastics smaller than 1000 μm accounted for 68\% of the total, while transparent, white, blue, and black were the primary colors of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. In addition, polyethylene and polypropylene are the primary materials of microplastics in the central Changjiang River Estuary and related water bodies, and fibers are the main shape of microplastics. Industry, agriculture, domestic sewage, and air deposition may be the primary sources of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. The numerous lakes and water conservancy facilities in the Changjiang River Basin can reduce the number of microplastics reaching the Changjiang Estuary to a certain extent. At the same time, seasonal rainfall and ocean currents will affect the abundance of microplastics in the surface waters of the Changjiang River Estuary. Finally, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions based on the actual situation of the Changjiang River Estuary and the developed microplastic treatment technologies. This article will provide a structured reference for future research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary and assist in assessing microplastics’ impact on the ecological environment.},
